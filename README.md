# EHM 2007 Retro Launcher

Initially released in 2011, the Retro Launcher is used in conjunction with the Custom Start Date Patch (CSD Patch) in order to allow a pre-1980 starting year/season in Eastside Hockey Manager 2007. This patch does not make any changes to the ehm2007.exe file or any other files on your computer. Similar to other cheat/memory utilities, the CSD Patch and the Retro Launcher alter some of the temporary data stored in your computer's RAM whilst EHM is running. By making these changes, it tricks EHM into using a year of your choice when starting a new game.

The Retro Launcher was last compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.
